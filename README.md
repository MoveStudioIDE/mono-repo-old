# Move Studio IDE - mono repo
An online IDE for building and deploying smart contracts on the Sui blockchain. Move Studio provides an environment for developers to create and build Sui Move packages as well as deploy and interact with objects on the Sui blockhain. 

This project was built to provide developers with efficient tools to build on the Sui blockchain. We support the Sui blockchain and want to contribute by improving the tools that the community can use. 

## Project version
The project is currently in the version 1.0. This entails all of the basic tools needed for simply building and deploying Sui Move packages. Now that 1.0 is published, we are currently planning and building the version 2.0 of the project. 2.0 will contain some general UI improvements as well as additional tools and features. 

## Updates, suggestions, and issues
The [Move Studio IDE discord](https://discord.gg/ep2MXBf9wy) is the place to keep track of project updates, ask questions, and request features. 

## Team
Currently the team is small but we are looking to grow so we can grow the Move Studio IDE at a faster rate.
